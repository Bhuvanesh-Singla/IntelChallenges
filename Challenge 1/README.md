# Optimization and Explainable Representation of a Dataset

## Overview

This project involves two sequential tasks aimed at understanding a dataset's underlying structure and behavior. The dataset contains 12 independent variables and a single dependent variable $y$ such that $y = f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{12})$.
- **Task 1:** Optimize the function $f(x)$ to find its minima using any suitable method.  
- **Task 2:** Represent the functional relationship between $y$ and the variables $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{12})$ in a comprehensible form. This involves employing methods that enhance explainability in artificial intelligence (AI).

### Deadline: **1st January 2025**

## Tasks and Instructions

### **Task 1: Optimization**
Find the minima of $f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{12})$

- Use any method or approach you are comfortable with, such as gradient descent, genetic algorithms, or other optimization techniques.  

### **Task 2: Explainable Functional Representation**
Represent the relationship $y = f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{12})$ in an explainable manner.

- Develop a mathematical equation or logical model that captures the functional relationship between the variables.  
- The focus should be on generating a form that is interpretable by humans, such as a regression equation, tree structure, or rule-based model.  
- Explainable AI (XAI) methods should be emphasized to ensure that the results are not just accurate but also transparent and understandable.

#### Importance of Explainability:
Explainable AI ensures that the models are interpretable and their predictions are trustworthy. By creating a functional representation, this task aims to bridge the gap between black-box models and human understanding.

### **Bonus**
Read other papers which discuss the explanability of black box models.
